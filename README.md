# Educational Inequality Analysis :mortar_board:

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a comprehensive analysis of global trends and patterns in educational inequality.

## Description

Educational inequality is a critical issue that affects millions of people worldwide. Understanding the trends and patterns in educational inequality can help policymakers, educators, and researchers develop targeted interventions to reduce inequality in different regions.

This notebook performs various analyses on a dataset containing historical data on educational inequality on a global scale. The analyses include clustering analysis, regional analysis, development group analysis, country-specific analysis, and correlation analysis.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis contains historical data covering a range of indicators pertaining to educational inequality on a global scale. The dataset's prominent components include ISO3, Country, Human Development Groups, UNDP Developing Regions, HDI Rank (2021), and Inequality in Education spanning the years 2010 to 2021.

## Analyses Performed

1. **Clustering Analysis**: Grouped countries with similar trends in educational inequality from 2010 to 2021.
2. **Regional Analysis**: Analyzed the inequality in education for each UNDP Developing Region and visualized the trends over the years.
3. **Development Group Analysis**: Analyzed the inequality in education for each Human Development Group and visualized the trends over the years.
4. **Country-Specific Analysis**: Analyzed the trend in educational inequality for a specific country and compared it with the global average.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzed the correlation between the HDI Rank and the inequality in education for each year and visualized the correlation matrix.
